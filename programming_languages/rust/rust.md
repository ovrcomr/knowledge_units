### History

Rust was originally developed by Mozilla Research, with Graydon Hoare starting the project in 2006.
It gained significant traction in 2010 when Mozilla officially sponsored it. The first stable release,
Rust 1.0, was launched in 2015. Since then, Rust has grown rapidly, with consistent community-driven improvements
and widespread industry adoption.

<br>

### Purpose

Rust is primarily designed for systems programming, making it a great alternative to languages like C and C++.
It is used for building web assembly applications, embedded systems, operating systems, game engines, and other
performance-sensitive software. Its memory safety guarantees make it particularly appealing for writing secure and
concurrent applications.

### Paradigms

- **Procedural programming**: Writing structured and modular code.
- **Functional programming**: First-class functions, immutability, and iterators.
- **Object-oriented programming**: Traits and structs enable modular and reusable code.

<br>

### Type system

- **Statically typed**: Type checking occurs at compile-time, preventing many runtime errors.
- **Strongly typed**: Prevents implicit type conversions that could lead to unintended behavior.

<br>

### Memory management

- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rustâ€™s unique ownership system ensures memory safety and eliminates data races.
- **No garbage collector**: Unlike languages like Java or Go, Rust does not rely on garbage collection, reducing runtime overhead.
- **Automatic memory deallocation**: The compiler ensures memory is freed when it is no longer needed, using a deterministic approach.

<br>

### Concurrency

- **Threads**: Safe multithreading without data races.
- **Async/Await**: Efficient asynchronous programming for high-performance applications.
- **Message Passing**: Channels for safe inter-thread communication.
