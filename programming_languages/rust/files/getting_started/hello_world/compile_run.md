After finishing to write a program, there is two steps before 'using' it.
The first one is *compiling* and the next one is *executing*.

Compiling is translating all the code into a file that the machine can read.
Executing is telling the machine to use the compiled file.

This will compile the `script_name.rs` code in a file called `script_name` :

```bash
rustc ./script_name.rs
```

To start excecuting the compiled file `script_name` :

```bash
./script_name
```
