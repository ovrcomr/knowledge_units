To create a project directory :

```bash
$ mkdir ~/project_folder
$ cd ~/project_folder
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
```

- `mkdir` stands for 'make directory', it creates a new folder at the current path.
- `cd` stands for 'change directory', it goes to the mentioned folder (or path).

The previous command block create a folder called `project_folder` that will
host every project that will be inside, go inside it, create another folder that
will host the `hello_world` project, and go inside it as well.
