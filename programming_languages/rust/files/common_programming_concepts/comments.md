**Comments** are used to :
- Anotate the program to give additional information
- Help for brainstorming and collaboration processes
- `//` is for single line comment.
- `/* */` is for multi-line comment.

```rust
// file_name.rs

fn main() {

    println!("The program is running...") // Print statement

    /*
        This is a simple Rust program
        that prints "The program is running..."
        using the `println!()` marco
    */

}
```
