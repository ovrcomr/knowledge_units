`match` arm's patterns must cover all possibilities. Consider this version of `plus_one` function which will not compile :

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}
```

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling enums v0.1.0 (file:///projects/enums)
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `None` not covered

Rust knows that we didnâ€™t cover every possible case, and even knows which pattern we forgot. Matches in Rust are exhaustive: we must exhaust every last possibility in
order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of `Option<T>`, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the `None` case, it protects us from assuming
that we have a value when we might have `null`, thus making mistake.
