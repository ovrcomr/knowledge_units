### History

C was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs as an evolution of the B language.
It played a crucial role in the development of the UNIX operating system and has influenced many modern languages, including C++, Java, and Python.

<br>

### Purpose
C is primarily designed for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
It is widely used for building operating systems, databases, compilers, and real-time applications.

### Paradigms

- Procedural Programming
- Structured Programming
- Imperative Programming

<br>

### Type system

- Statically typed
- Weakly typed (allows implicit type conversions)

<br>

### Memory management

- Manual memory management using malloc() and free()
- No built-in garbage collection

<br>

## Concurrency

- Supports multithreading via libraries like pthread
- No built-in concurrency primitives in the standard

### Frameworks

- Standard Library (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, etc.)
- POSIX API (for Unix-based systems)
- GTK+ (GUI development)
- SDL (Game development)
- OpenGL (Graphics programming)

<br>

### Community

- Forums: Stack Overflow, Cprogramming.com, r/C_Programming
- Conferences: CppCon (covers C topics), FOSDEM

<br>

<br>

### Usecases

- Operating Systems (Linux, Windows components)
- Embedded Systems (Microcontrollers, IoT devices)
- High-Performance Applications (Databases like MySQL, game engines)
- Compilers and Interpreters (GCC, Clang)

<br>

### Successes

- UNIX and Linux kernels
- Microsoft Windows components
- PostgreSQL and MySQL databases
